# bd - Bread Diary!

### A CLI application intended to help bakers tweak recipes and track successful bakes.

As both a novice baker I frequently find myself trying new recipes or altering variables in familiar recipes in order to achieve "better" bakes. This tinkering is haphazard and is difficult to draw general patterns from since I don't collect data about each attempt in a structured manner.

This application will help a baker improve over time, by systematically collecting the tweaks a baker must make from the original recipe. This data will enable bakers to draw conclusions about how their baking environment differs from recipe authors.

The goal of *bd* is to help backers tackle new recipes with increased confidence in the little tweaks necessary to ensure a great bake!
